### Installation (60 seconds)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Sherin-SEF-AI/code-genie.git
cd codegenie

# Run automated installation
./scripts/install.sh

# Start CodeGenie
codegenie
```

### Your First Command

```bash
codegenie
> create a REST API endpoint for user registration with email validation
```

That's it! CodeGenie will analyze your project, generate the code, create tests, and integrate everything seamlessly.

## 🎨 Features

### 1. Multi-Agent System

Specialized AI agents work together to handle different aspects of development:

- **🏗️ Architect Agent** - System design and architecture decisions
- **👨‍💻 Developer Agent** - Code implementation and refactoring
- **🔒 Security Agent** - Vulnerability scanning and security hardening
- **⚡ Performance Agent** - Performance optimization and profiling
- **🧪 Testing Agent** - Test generation and quality assurance
- **📝 Documentation Agent** - Automated documentation generation

### 2. Autonomous Workflows

Execute complex tasks with a single command:

```bash
> /autonomous on
> Build a complete authentication system with JWT, password hashing, and rate limiting
```

CodeGenie creates an execution plan, implements all components, writes tests, and validates everything automatically.

### 3. Code Intelligence

- **Semantic Analysis** - Understand code meaning, not just syntax
- **Impact Analysis** - See what breaks before you make changes
- **Knowledge Graph** - Track relationships between code components
- **Pattern Recognition** - Identify code smells and suggest improvements

### 4. Natural Language Programming

Describe what you want in plain English:

```
> I need a system where users can create posts, comment on them, and like both posts and comments
```

CodeGenie clarifies requirements, designs the system, and implements everything.

### 5. Terminal Integration

Native shell integration for seamless workflow:

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc
eval "$(codegenie shell-init bash)"

# Now use anywhere
$ ask how do I optimize this database query
```

### 6. Privacy & Security

- **Local Execution** - All processing happens on your machine
- **Sandboxed Commands** - Safe execution environment
- **Audit Logging** - Track all operations
- **No Telemetry** - Optional, opt-in analytics only
